To use Ecm SPY, you need a compatible Buell motorcycle, a laptop or tablet with Windows operating system, a USB cable, and an interface device that connects your bike's diagnostic port to your computer. You also need to download and install the Ecm SPY software from [https://www.ecmspy.com/](https://www.ecmspy.com/).
 
Here are the steps to set up your Buell motorcycle with Ecm SPY:
 
1. Turn off your bike's ignition and connect the interface device to the diagnostic port under the seat. The diagnostic port is a black 6-pin connector that is usually covered by a rubber cap.
2. Connect the USB cable from the interface device to your computer. Make sure the drivers for the interface device are installed correctly.
3. Launch the Ecm SPY software on your computer. You should see a welcome screen with some options.
4. Select "Connect" to establish communication with your bike's ECM. You should see a green light on the bottom right corner of the screen indicating that the connection is successful.
5. Select "Read" to download the current configuration of your bike's ECM. This will take a few seconds and you will see a progress bar on the screen.
6. Select "Save" to save a backup copy of your original configuration. This is important in case you want to restore it later.
7. Select "Tune" to access the tuning options. You can adjust various parameters such as fuel maps, ignition maps, idle speed, rev limiter, fan activation temperature, and more. You can also view real-time data from your bike's sensors such as engine speed, throttle position, air temperature, oxygen sensor voltage, and more.
8. After making any changes, select "Write" to upload them to your bike's ECM. This will take a few seconds and you will see a progress bar on the screen.
9. Select "Disconnect" to end communication with your bike's ECM. You can then turn on your bike's ignition and test the results.

Note: Before making any changes, make sure you understand what each parameter does and how it affects your bike's performance. Some changes may require additional modifications such as exhaust system, air filter, spark plugs, etc. Some changes may also affect your bike's emissions and warranty. Always make small changes at a time and test them carefully. If you encounter any problems, you can always restore your original configuration by selecting "Open" and choosing the backup file you saved earlier.

## Benefits of Ecm SPY for Buell Motorcycles
 
Ecm SPY is not only a tool for tuning your Buell motorcycle, but also a tool for improving its reliability, safety, and comfort. By using Ecm SPY, you can enjoy the following benefits:

- You can monitor the health of your bike's sensors and detect any faults or errors that may affect its performance or cause damage. For example, you can check the oxygen sensor voltage, the intake air temperature, the engine temperature, the battery voltage, and more. You can also clear any trouble codes that may appear on your dashboard.
- You can optimize your bike's fuel delivery and ignition timing to match your riding style, preferences, and conditions. You can adjust the fuel maps and ignition maps for each cylinder and each throttle position. You can also modify other parameters such as idle speed, rev limiter, exhaust valve switching points, fan activation temperature, and more. You can achieve better throttle response, smoother power delivery, increased torque and horsepower, improved fuel economy, and reduced emissions.
- You can reset your bike's adaptive fuel value (AFV) to 100% whenever you want. The AFV is a parameter that adjusts the fuel delivery based on the feedback from the oxygen sensor. Over time, the AFV may drift away from 100% due to various factors such as altitude, temperature, fuel quality, etc. This may result in suboptimal performance or increased emissions. By resetting the AFV to 100%, you can ensure that your bike is running at its best.
- You can customize your bike's features and functions to suit your needs and preferences. For example, you can enable or disable the exhaust valve that controls the sound and back pressure of your exhaust system. You can also change the fan activation temperature to keep your engine cooler or warmer depending on the weather. You can also enable or disable the diagnostic mode that allows you to test various components of your bike such as lights, gauges, switches, etc.

Ecm SPY is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you get the most out of your Buell motorcycle. By using Ecm SPY regularly, you can keep your bike in top condition and enjoy its full potential.
